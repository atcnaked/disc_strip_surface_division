# disc_strip_surface_division



Paint a disc with vertical colored strips starting at some values.  
Basic example implements strips of equal surface (originally designed to equally split a pizza in strips).  

The disc can be rotated, strip color can be costumized. 

values are increasing double between 0 and 1 and represent the proportion of the width of the disc, 
colors is determined by looping over the color List.
