# disc_strip_surface_division



Paint a disc with vertical colored strips starting at some values.  
The disc can be rotated.
Strip color can be costumized. 
Basic example implements strips of equal surface (originally designed to equally split a pizza in strips)

values are increasing double between 0 and 1 and represent the proportion of the width of the disc, 
colors is determined by looping over the color List.
